# Control CLI

Exercise an interactive CLI with a repeatable harness instead of trying it by hand. `drive-app` says which terminal tool this environment has. This skill says how to drive the program one input at a time, and how to build a temporary harness from standard tools when the environment has none.

## Use it for

- Reproducing a CLI or TUI bug with fixed input.
- Checking keyboard flows, prompts, interrupts, resizing, and terminal layout.
- Capturing before and after transcripts for a bug fix.
- Profiling startup time, slow operations, hangs, or memory growth.
- Recording a short terminal demo when the output is easier to show than to explain.

## Harness loop

1. Name the command under test and the smallest workspace that reproduces the behavior.
2. Look for a harness the repository already has, such as package scripts, end-to-end tests, demo recorders, expect scripts, or PTY helpers.
3. If there is none, start the CLI in its own terminal session with fixed environment variables. Use the tool `drive-app` resolves to, or one of the temporary harnesses below.
4. Capture the screen before you send anything.
5. Send one action at a time: text, Enter, an arrow key, Escape, Ctrl-C, or a resize.
6. Wait for a specific screen pattern or prompt before the next action.
7. Save the transcript and any profile artifacts.
8. End the session cleanly.

## Harness options

- **The repository's own harness.** Prefer checked-in scripts, because they know the app's startup, environment, and prompts.
- **`tmux`.** Managed sessions with `capture-pane`, `send-keys`, attach, and detach.
- **A PTY probe.** A short Python, Node, or Expect script, when `tmux` is not installed.
- **A runtime inspector.** The Node or Bun inspector for CPU profiles, heap snapshots, and live evaluation. `inspect-runtime` says how to attach here.
- **A terminal recorder.** The repository's demo tools, or an asciinema-compatible recorder, when the user asks for a demo.

`<scratch>` below is a folder from `mktemp -d`.

## A minimal tmux harness

`wait_for` polls the screen until a pattern appears, so no step waits a fixed time. It fails at once when the program has exited and taken its session with it. `capture-pane` drops trailing spaces, so match a prompt such as `> ` as `^>$`.

```bash
SESSION="cli-harness-$(date +%s)"
wait_for() {
  for _ in $(seq 100); do
    screen=$(tmux capture-pane -pt "$SESSION") || return 1
    grep -q -- "$1" <<<"$screen" && return 0
    sleep 0.1
  done
  echo "timed out waiting for: $1" >&2
  return 1
}
tmux new-session -d -s "$SESSION" -- <command-under-test>
wait_for "<ready pattern>"
tmux capture-pane -pt "$SESSION" > <scratch>/before.txt
tmux send-keys -t "$SESSION" "help" Enter
wait_for "<text the answer prints>"
tmux capture-pane -pt "$SESSION" > <scratch>/after.txt
tmux kill-session -t "$SESSION"
```

For a Node CLI:

```bash
NODE_OPTIONS="--inspect=127.0.0.1:0" tmux new-session -d -s "$SESSION" -- <node-cli-command>
```

Read the inspector URL from the terminal output, then profile with a tool that speaks the Chrome DevTools Protocol.

## A minimal PTY harness

Use a PTY script when you need exact waits and the repository has no `tmux` or demo harness. Keep it temporary unless the user asks for a reusable test.

```python
import os
import pty
import select
import subprocess
import time

master_fd, slave_fd = pty.openpty()
proc = subprocess.Popen(
    ["<command>", "<arg>"],
    stdin=slave_fd,
    stdout=slave_fd,
    stderr=slave_fd,
    close_fds=True,
)
os.close(slave_fd)

deadline = time.time() + 30
buffer = b""
while time.time() < deadline:
    ready, _, _ = select.select([master_fd], [], [], 0.25)
    if not ready:
        continue
    chunk = os.read(master_fd, 4096)
    buffer += chunk
    if b"<ready text>" in buffer:
        os.write(master_fd, b"help\n")
        break

print(buffer.decode(errors="replace"))
proc.terminate()
os.close(master_fd)
```

If the CLI needs richer terminal control, use `pty.fork()` or a PTY library the project already has.

## Profiling

- **Startup regression.** Time the baseline and the change on the same computer, environment, and command.
- **Slow operation.** Start a CPU profile, run the operation, stop the profile, and compare the functions with the most self time.
- **Memory leak.** Force garbage collection if you can, take a heap snapshot, run the operation many times, force garbage collection again, and take another snapshot.
- **Hang.** Capture the screen, the active handles and resources, and a stack or CPU sample before you interrupt.

## Rules

- Wait for a pattern, not a fixed time. If you must sleep, say why.
- Do not send credentials or destructive commands into a session you drive.
- Keep a temporary harness in a `mktemp -d` folder, unless the repository already has a test or demo harness.
- Do not copy paths from another repository. Adapt commands to this repository's scripts and runtime.
- Remove `tmux` sessions, temp folders, inspector processes, and demo artifacts when you are done, unless the user asks to keep them.
